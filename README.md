# Blooket-Bomb
This script is to allow you to be able to bomb blooket games with bots over and over again!


# Installation
Step 1. To get started you will first need google chrome installed as this script uses the google chrome driver(this   will be updated in the future for support on different drivers). If you have google chrome installed you can skip to Step 2. To install google chrome...                                                                
```wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb```

Then

```apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb```

Step 2. Next move the chromedriver included with the git clone to your PATH.


Step 3. Next install the requirements via ```pip3 install requirements.txt```, then you're good to go!


# Usage
```python3 main.py```
You will then be promted to input your game code as well as the name you would like to use!


# Future Updates
There are multiple features I am working on currently, such as improving the speed as the current speed is only a bot every few seconds or so. As well as adding a Web UI for users to be able to use this from any device anywhere!


# WARNING
Blooket is a popular education website that many teachers use to teach students. Using this script in the classroom against teachers or instructors is done at your own being. I am not liable for anything as a result of the usage of this script.
